### Hi, I’m Shani 👋


<ins>**About me**</ins>

I’m a Junior Software Engineer with a creative background in TV and film, where I worked on projects for Netflix and Hulu. After transitioning into tech, I completed the Web Development Bootcamp at Le Wagon, where I gained hands-on experience building web applications using JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, and SQL.

I love combining creativity with technical problem-solving to create user-focused and impactful digital experiences. My previous experience in customer-facing roles has given me a strong understanding of real-world user needs, which I bring into every project I work on.

**📚 Final Bootcamp Project:**

I led the development of BookSwap, a community-based app designed to make books more accessible by enabling swaps, organising meetups, and fostering discussions.

**🌟 What I’m Learning:**

I’m focused on front-end development, honing my JavaScript skills, and enhancing my knowledge of UX/UI design. I’m also sharpening my proficiency in Figma to bring intuitive and visually engaging digital experiences to life.

**🌍 Interests:**

When I’m not coding, you’ll often find me exploring new places—I love traveling and immersing myself in different cultures. Aviation is another passion of mine; I’m fascinated by flight and dream of one day earning my private pilot’s license. I’m also a big fan of art, whether it’s creating pottery, painting, or diving into the world of design. These interests fuel my creativity and inspire my work in tech!

💡 Let’s connect! I’m always up for collaborating on exciting projects or chatting about all things tech and design.
